"""
Displays statistics about two song lyrics

Module takes two text files from user input.
Then the files are parsed and the following statistics calulated for
both songs:
Total words, distinct words, 8 most common words, longest word,
4-letters+ long words that appear more than 3 times, and common words
between the two lyrics that are 4-letters+ long.
Each statistic is formatted and printed
